								<h1>About Me</h1>																
							</header>
							<p>Hi there! I'm Michael Keller, and welcome to my site! Here you can see the previous work I've done during my academic/professional career.</p>
							<p>Some background on me--I am a data scientist and an alumnus of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, FL. I graduated with a Masters in AI at age 21 in Fall 2020.
							I also have a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from FAU and am an alumnus of FAU High School. <a href="http://fauhigh.fau.edu/">FAU High</a> is an accelerated high school dual enrollment program where students are prepared
							for college in their freshman year, and if they succeed, they begin as a full-time undergraduate student during their sophomore year and get dual credit for the 
							remaining three years.</p>
							<p>After graduating from the Mathematics program in 2018, I joined the MS in Computer Science program. But, when FAU created an MS in Artificial Intelligence program,
							I switched to that as it suited my interests more. Here on this site you will see that much of my work focuses on the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning. In 
							these pages, you will see that I have dabbled into many of the various facets of Machine Learning, including Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning
							and Deep Reinforcement Learning. You will also see some of my work in more traditional computer science circles. </p>
							<p>I am very passionate about the data science/AI space. My favorite work has always been in the
								realms of classification, especially classification using Deep Learning and Neural Networks, as well as Reinforcement Learning. 
								I currently work at LTK, tackling fun data science problems to help improve their business in the social media space. </p>							
							<p>Thank you for taking the time to check out some of my work. Enjoy, and see my contact information below if you have any questions!</p>
