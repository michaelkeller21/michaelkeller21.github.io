							<h1>About Me</h1>																
						</header>
						<p>Hi there! I'm Michael Keller, and welcome to my site! I am a data scientist and an alumnus of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, FL.</p>
						<p>I am very passionate about the data science/AI space. My favorite work has always been in the
							realms of classification, especially classification using Deep Learning and Neural Networks, as well as Reinforcement Learning. </p> 
						<p>I currently work at LTK alongside a really talented team of other data scienists. During my time there, I have helped build a text classification model
							to help classify the products sold on their app as well as an image classification model to help identify the common posts on their app
							(first binary then expanded to multiclass). More recently I have dabbled in creating internal libraries in Python to help send out personalized emails at scale,
							and also did some clustering work on their shoppers to help their marketing team identify shopper behavior.
						</p>
						<p>Before all this, I was a Masters student in Artificial Intelligence at FAU, a researcher at FAU's MPCR Lab, a tutor, and an ambitous teenage undergraduate dual enrolled at <a href="http://fauhigh.fau.edu/"></a>FAU High.</p>
						<p>When I'm not working, I'm basically your average supernerd. I'm a fan of all things sci-fi, Harry Potter, and fantasy. I also have a deep love for baseball and basketball.</p>
						<p>See my "College Archives" section if you want to see some of the cool work I did as a student.</p>							
						<p>Thank you for taking the time to check out some of my work. Enjoy, and see my contact information below if you have any questions!</p>
